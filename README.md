# SampleProjectDescription
This is to help familiarize myself with using Github repositories.


I am well aware that Github would be a useful tool during my internship, so I need decent knowledge of the technology. I will also be adding some programming files from previous programming courses.

In this repository, JAVA would be the main programming language.
